# Travelopia Project

## Features

- Fluid Responsive
- Used **calc()** in css to calculate the hieght the of the mid section
- Header and footer are **100px** and mid section is **calc(100vh - 200px)** which will make the page as fluid responsive and there will be no scrollbar present
- In the navbar I have used humburger icon when the view port width get smaller than **800px** and hide nav inks which were present when the width was more than **800px** which gives us a responsive design for mobile, tablet and web.
- Used **position** property to handle the image present in mid section and also used an overlay and used **overflow-hidden** so it does not let stretch the image
